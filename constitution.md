# Evolution of Todo – Engineering Constitution

## Core Principles
1. Spec-Driven Development is mandatory.
2. Humans must not write implementation code.
3. All code must be generated by an LLM (Gemini).
4. Specs define all behavior.
5. No undocumented behavior is allowed.

## Development Rules
- Follow specs strictly.
- No extra features.
- Code must be production-ready.

## AI Rules
- Gemini generates all code.
- Prompts must include full spec and acceptance criteria.

## Technology Constraints
- Backend language chosen by Gemini.
- AI integrations defined in later phases.
- Docker & Kubernetes required in later phases.

## Documentation Rules
- Each phase must have a spec.
- Acceptance criteria required.
